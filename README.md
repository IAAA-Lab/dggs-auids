# DGGS Area Unique IDs
A Juypter notebook with some experiments on producing unique area identifiers on a DGGS. To take a quick look on it you can [render it on GitHub](https://github.com/IAAA-Lab/dggs-auids/blob/master/dggs-auids.ipynb).

## Installation
This has been developed with JupyterLab 0.35.3 and Python 3.6. The environment, i.e. required Python modules and other software, has been managed from Anaconda Navigator 1.9.6 and Conda version 4.5.12.

Make sure you have at least installed Python 3.6+ and Conda 4.5.12+. Then:

- Clone this repository on your computer.
- To create the conda environment and download the required modules, run `conda env create -f conda_environment.yml` or use Anaconda Navigator (Environments > Import) with that file. This will create a conda environment named dggs_auids in your computer.
- Run `conda activate dggs_auids` to activate the environment. You can also use Anaconda Navigator (Environments, and double click on the dggs_auids environment; you may need to restart the Anaconda Navigator to see it).
- After this you can run, for instance, `jupyter-lab`, load the notebook `dggs-auids.ipynb` there and run it on your computer. You can launch Jupyter lab from Anaconda Navigator if you prefer.
